unfortunatly i deleted the hugo sorces for this homepage â€“ so i rebuild it from scratch.
i stripped down all javascript and bootstrap and went back to pure css.
</br>
a few features yet have to be implemented. also i think about using a single org-file for content management.

to avoid another backup desaster, i also pushed the theme and the content files to github.
