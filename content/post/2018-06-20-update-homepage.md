unfortunatly i deleted the hugo sorces for this homepage. and gladly my hoster [celeros](https://celeros.de/) made it possible to use [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates. a good reason to rebuild my homepage from scratch.</br>
i stripped down all javascript and bootstrap and went back to pure css.
</br>
a few features yet have to be implemented. also i think about using a single org-file for content management in the future.

to avoid another backup desaster, i also pushed the theme and the content files to github.
